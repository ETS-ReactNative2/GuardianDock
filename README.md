## Introduction

GuardianDock is an old school project developed for the EPITECH HUB module.

The first version was developed with [TrueBabyChaise](https://github.com/TrueBabyChaise) and [EternalRat](https://github.com/EternalRat).

GuardianDock is a mobile application developed with React-Native using TypeScript. The first version didn't use any UI frameworks and this version developed using Native-Base and Native-Base Icons.

First, it had 4 functionalities. It shows stats for 3 games such as ***Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019)***, ***Destiny 2*** and ***Fortnite***. It also showed ***Fortnite News***.
We wanted to implement a Destiny 2 Inventory in order to help player change their in-game inventory but we never released it because we didn't know how OAuth2 was working.

After school delivery, the project was abandoned and not maintained anymore unit September 2021 when I decided to work again on this project.

This project is actually maintained and in rework phase.

## Motivation

This project was initially developed to discover AppDev. It was also the opportunity to learn about APIs and how to use them.

For this rework phase, this project is developed to update API call and increase AppDev competencies.

## Installation

It is deprecated! Don't look at this: ~~An installation tutorial is present here.~~

The installation wiki page will be updated on next release.

## Important Notices

  * Destiny 2 API has changed base URL.
  * CoD:MW (2019) and Fortnite API tokens expired.
  * React Native Components don't use any UI Framework.


* This project is in development phase. It may take a while for it to be fully back.
